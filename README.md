# Catch-The-Ball
Make sure you have directplay install or it will take a bit to load you don't need it but it's recomended so make sure you add windows features and i think it'll run on windows xp
and later not sure so i'd say at least use windows 7 or vista if you want to use it on an older machine maybe even burn it on a disc, something like that. it requires
Minimum specification 
Required                   Recommended
Processor speed (MHz)	233	300 or higher
RAM (MB)	64	128 or higher
so if you want to run it on an older machine it needs at least like an intel core duo or something like that
